 Uses version 4.26 currently
 
 These are the full project files for friday night 3D

 

The project's documentation is bad and most of the code has not been properly cleaned as of now use at your own discretion
Keep in mind that since the project was not intended for sharing I still haven't bothered with proper documentation at all

But hey!!
If you are a wizard and want to see how the spaghetti works, then go ahead

The project was made using 100% Blueprints (Even I'm surprised that It works)
